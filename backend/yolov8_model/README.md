# Weapon and Knievs Detection System

This repository contains the source code and resources related to the academic weapon detection project, developed as part of research in the area of ​​computer security.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to design and implement an advanced system for the autonomous detection of firearms and knives. Using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) framework and transfer learning techniques, we seek to improve security effectiveness through continuous, real-time surveillance.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Framework:** One implementation uses YOLOv8, known for its efficiency in real-time object detection.
  
- **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning techniques are employed to adapt the model to a specific context and improve accuracy in weapon detection.

- **Integration with IP Cameras:** The system is designed for easy integration with IP cameras, allowing for real-time surveillance and immediate notifications.
