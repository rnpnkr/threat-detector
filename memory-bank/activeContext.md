# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Successfully implemented and tested the Flask API with YOLOv8 model integration
- Working detection endpoint at http://localhost:5001/detect
- Frontend development server running at http://localhost:8080
- Tested with sample image (concept-terrorist.jpg) showing successful detection
- Implemented detailed detection response format
- Frontend UI implementation in progress
- React application setup with TypeScript and Vite

## Recent Changes
- Moved Flask server to port 5001 to avoid AirPlay conflicts
- Frontend development server configured to run on port 8080
- Updated .env configuration with correct paths and settings
- Enhanced API response with detailed detection information:
  - Bounding box coordinates
  - Confidence scores
  - Class information
  - Image and model metadata
- Successfully tested the complete pipeline:
  - Image upload
  - Detection processing
  - Result storage
  - Detailed response formatting
- Added frontend project structure:
  - React with TypeScript
  - Vite build system
  - Shadcn UI components
  - Tailwind CSS styling

## Active Decisions
- Using port 5001 for Flask server (avoiding AirPlay conflicts)
- Using port 8080 for frontend development server
- Detection threshold set to 0.3 (30%)
- Output paths configured in .env:
  - Uploads: ./uploads/
  - Annotated images: ./yolov8_model/imgs/Test/
- Response format includes:
  - Detection details
  - Bounding boxes
  - Confidence scores
  - Image and model metadata
- Frontend technology stack:
  - React 18 with TypeScript
  - Vite for build
  - Shadcn UI for components
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

## Current Implementation Status
- Backend:
  - API Endpoints:
    - GET http://localhost:5001/health - Working
    - POST http://localhost:5001/detect - Working with detailed response format
  - Model Integration:
    - YOLOv8 model successfully loading
    - Detection working with proper confidence scores
    - Image processing and annotation functional
    - Detailed detection data extraction
  - File Management:
    - Upload directory working
    - Output directory working
    - File naming convention established
  - Response Format:
    - Structured JSON output
    - Detailed detection information
    - Image and model metadata
    - Error handling and status codes

- Frontend:
  - Development Server:
    - Running on http://localhost:8080
    - Hot reloading enabled
    - Vite development server
  - Project Structure:
    - Components directory setup
    - Pages directory setup
    - Hooks directory setup
    - Lib directory setup
  - Build System:
    - Vite configuration
    - TypeScript setup
    - Tailwind CSS configuration
  - UI Components:
    - Shadcn UI integration
    - Basic layout components
  - API Integration:
    - React Query setup
    - API client configuration
    - Type definitions

## Next Steps
1. Backend:
   - Consider implementing additional endpoints:
     - Batch processing
     - Detection history
     - Configuration updates
   - Add more robust error handling
   - Implement logging system
   - Consider adding authentication
   - Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Add detection statistics tracking

2. Frontend:
   - Implement main UI components
   - Add image upload functionality
   - Create detection results display
   - Implement error handling
   - Add loading states
   - Set up routing
   - Add user authentication (if needed)
   - Implement responsive design
   - Configure CORS for local development

## Current Considerations
- Backend:
  - Need to monitor memory usage with large images
  - Consider implementing cleanup for old uploads
  - May need to optimize image processing for large files
  - Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints
  - Monitor detection data structure performance
  - Consider adding detection statistics tracking

- Frontend:
  - Bundle size optimization
  - Performance optimization
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - State management
  - Error handling strategy
  - Loading state management
  - API integration testing
  - CORS configuration for local development
  - Proxy configuration for API requests
