# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Successfully implemented Flask API with YOLOv8 integration
- Implemented real-time WebSocket communication between frontend and backend
- Frontend displays annotated images with backend-drawn bounding boxes
- Alert system for high-severity threats

## Recent Changes
1. Backend:
   - Moved image storage to `backend/static/images/` structure
   - Added WebSocket support using flask-sock
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Centralized image processing in backend

2. Frontend:
   - Removed frontend bounding box rendering
   - Simplified detection display
   - Added WebSocket connection for real-time updates
   - Improved UI with Shadcn components

## Active Decisions
1. Image Processing:
   - All detection visualization handled by backend OpenCV
   - Frontend only displays pre-annotated images
   - Images stored in structured directories under backend/static

2. Communication:
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - REST API for image upload and processing
   - Static file serving for images

3. Configuration:
   - Detection threshold set to 0.3
   - Flask server running on port 5001
   - Frontend dev server on port 8080

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend
✅ Implemented:
- Flask API with endpoints for detection and static files
- YOLOv8 model integration
- WebSocket notifications
- Image processing and annotation
- Structured file storage
- Error handling and logging

### Frontend
✅ Implemented:
- Real-time camera feed display
- WebSocket connection
- Alert system for threats
- Control buttons (scanning, recording, fullscreen)
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps
1. Backend:
   - Add support for video streams
   - Implement detection history logging
   - Add authentication and security
   - Optimize image processing

2. Frontend:
   - Add multiple camera view support
   - Implement detection history view
   - Add configuration panel
   - Enhance alert customization

## Current Considerations
1. Performance:
   - Monitor WebSocket connection stability
   - Track image processing speed
   - Optimize memory usage

2. Security:
   - Add input validation
   - Implement file size limits
   - Add authentication

3. Scalability:
   - Plan for multiple camera support
   - Consider video stream processing
   - Prepare for increased load

4. User Experience:
   - Monitor alert effectiveness
   - Track system responsiveness
   - Gather feedback on UI/UX
