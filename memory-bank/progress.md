# Project Progress

## Completed Features
‚úÖ Basic Image Detection System
- Implemented Flask API for image upload
- Integrated YOLOv8 model for weapon detection
- Successfully detects guns and knives in static images
- Displays detection results with bounding boxes
- Working demo with curl command: `curl -X POST -F "image=@backend/yolov8_model/imgs/Test/concept_terrorist_2.jpg" http://localhost:5001/detect`

## In Progress
üîÑ Real-time Video Processing
- Planning video feed integration
- Evaluating performance requirements
- Designing frame processing pipeline

üîÑ Profiling System
- Planning architecture
- Evaluating model options
- Designing data flow

üîÑ Alert System
- Planning WhatsApp integration
- Designing notification format
- Planning officer contact management

## Pending Features
‚ùå Real-time Video Feed Integration
- CCTV camera integration
- Frame processing optimization
- Real-time detection pipeline

‚ùå Profiling System
- Threat identification model
- Data collection and processing
- Profile generation

‚ùå WhatsApp Alert System
- API integration
- Message formatting
- Officer contact management

‚ùå LLM Integration
- Language processing
- Message translation
- Custom alert generation

## Known Issues
- Current system only handles static images
- No real-time processing capability
- No profiling or alert system
- Limited to local deployment

## Next Milestones
1. Implement real-time video processing
2. Develop profiling system
3. Integrate WhatsApp alerts
4. Add LLM support for multi-language

## What Works
- YOLOv8 model integration for weapon detection
- Flask API setup with endpoints:
  - `/health` for health check
  - `/detect` for image processing
  - `/static/<filename>` for serving annotated images
- Environment configuration with .env file
- Git configuration with proper .gitignore
- Directory structure maintained with .gitkeep files

## What's Left to Build
- Frontend UI components
- Real-time detection capabilities
- User authentication system
- Alert notification system
- Deployment configuration
- Testing suite

## Current Status
- Backend API is functional and properly configured
- Static file serving is implemented
- Git repository is properly configured with:
  - Appropriate .gitignore rules
  - Directory structure maintained
  - Test and annotated images excluded
- Development environment is properly set up

## Known Issues
- Port 5000 conflicts with AirPlay (resolved by using port 5001)
- Need to implement proper error handling
- Require additional security measures
- Performance optimization needed for large files
