# Project Progress

## Completed Features
‚úÖ Basic Image Detection System
- Implemented Flask API for image upload
- Integrated YOLOv8 model for weapon detection
- Successfully detects guns and knives in static images
- Displays detection results with bounding boxes
- Working demo with curl command: `curl -X POST -F "image=@backend/yolov8_model/imgs/Test/concept_terrorist_2.jpg" http://localhost:5001/detect`

‚úÖ UI Implementation
- Basic UI for system interaction
- Image upload and display
- Detection results visualization with bounding boxes
- Demo options for:
  - Preloaded video selection
  - Live streaming from Android device
  - Language selection (Marathi, English, Hindi)

‚úÖ Video Streaming Branch
- Feature/streaming branch contains video processing logic
- Basic video streaming implementation
- Android device integration capability

## In Progress
üîÑ Model Enhancement (Rohan)
- Working on improving YOLOv8 model for video streaming
- Optimizing detection accuracy for real-time processing

üîÑ Image Capture Logic
- Implementing custom logic to save high-confidence detections
- Preventing duplicate image saves
- Optimizing storage and processing

üîÑ Profiling System
- Implementing profiler model
- Processing detection data
- Generating profile information (age, height, complexion)

üîÑ Alert System
- WhatsApp integration
- OpenAI integration for multi-language support
- Message formatting with detection data and profile information

## Pending Features
‚ùå Real-time Video Processing
- Integration of improved YOLOv8 model
- Frame processing optimization
- Real-time detection pipeline

‚ùå Profiling System
- Complete implementation of profile generation
- Data collection and processing
- Integration with detection system

‚ùå WhatsApp Alert System
- Complete API integration
- Multi-language message formatting
- Alert management system

## Known Issues
- Current YOLOv8 model not performing well on video streaming
- Need to implement duplicate image prevention
- Pending integration of profiling and alert systems
- Limited to local deployment

## Next Milestones
1. Integrate improved YOLOv8 model for video
2. Implement image capture logic for high-confidence detections
3. Complete profiling system implementation
4. Integrate WhatsApp alerts with OpenAI translation
5. Merge feature/streaming branch to main

## What Works
- YOLOv8 model integration for static image detection
- Flask API setup with endpoints:
  - `/health` for health check
  - `/detect` for image processing
  - `/static/<filename>` for serving annotated images
- UI for demo options and language selection
- Basic video streaming implementation in feature/streaming branch

## What's Left to Build
- Improved video detection model
- High-confidence image capture logic
- Complete profiling system
- WhatsApp alert system with multi-language support
- Integration of all components
- Testing and optimization

## Current Status
- Backend API is functional for static images
- UI is implemented with demo options
- Video streaming branch exists but needs model improvement
- Profiling and alert systems in development
- Multi-language support planned with OpenAI integration
