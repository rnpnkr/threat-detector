# Project Progress

## Completed Features
‚úÖ Basic Image Detection System
- Implemented Flask API for image upload (`/detect`)
- Integrated MMDetection (ConvNext) model from `CCTV_GUN` for gun detection
- Displays detection results with bounding boxes
- Working demo with curl command: `curl -X POST -F "image=@backend/CCTV_GUN/tools/testing/input/image.jpeg" http://localhost:5001/detect`

‚úÖ Video Streaming Endpoint
- Implemented WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/video`) for video processing.
- Integrated MMDetection (ConvNext) for frame-by-frame gun detection.
- Implemented frame skipping (1/15 frames) for performance optimization.
- Streams annotated frames and detections to connected clients.

‚úÖ UI Implementation
- Basic UI for system interaction
- Image upload and display
- Detection results visualization with bounding boxes
- Demo options for:
  - Preloaded video selection (Connects to `/ws/video`)
  - Live streaming from Android device
  - Language selection (Marathi, English, Hindi)

## In Progress
üîÑ Performance Optimization
- Investigating GPU deployment options (GCP/AWS/Azure with T4 GPU).
- Plan to switch inference device from `cpu` to `cuda:0`.

üîÑ Code Cleanup
- Planning to remove unused YOLOv8 code and directories.
- Reviewing model loading strategy for `/detect` endpoint (currently per-call).

üîÑ Image Capture Logic
- Implementing custom logic to save high-confidence detections
- Preventing duplicate image saves
- Optimizing storage and processing

üîÑ Profiling System
- Implementing profiler model
- Processing detection data
- Generating profile information (age, height, complexion)

üîÑ Alert System
- WhatsApp integration
- OpenAI integration for multi-language support
- Message formatting with detection data and profile information

## Pending Features
‚ùå GPU Deployment & Tuning
- Set up cloud GPU instance.
- Deploy application and test performance.
- Tune frame skipping or other parameters based on GPU speed.

‚ùå Profiling System
- Complete implementation of profile generation
- Data collection and processing
- Integration with detection system

‚ùå WhatsApp Alert System
- Complete API integration
- Multi-language message formatting
- Alert management system

## Known Issues
- MMDetection inference is slow on CPU (~2.4s/frame), limiting real-time detection frequency in video stream (mitigated by frame skipping).
- Need to implement duplicate image prevention for saved detections.
- Pending integration of profiling and alert systems.
- `/detect` endpoint loads MMDetection model on every call (potential optimization needed).

## Next Milestones
1. Deploy backend to a GPU instance (e.g., GCP/AWS/Azure).
2. Configure and test MMDetection inference on GPU (`cuda:0`).
3. Evaluate performance and adjust frame skipping / optimize further.
4. Clean up and remove old YOLOv8 code/files.
5. Implement image capture logic for high-confidence detections.
6. Complete profiling system implementation.
7. Integrate WhatsApp alerts with OpenAI translation.

## What Works
- MMDetection (ConvNext) integration for static image gun detection (`/detect`).
- MMDetection (ConvNext) integration for video stream gun detection (`/ws/video`) with frame skipping.
- Flask API setup with endpoints:
  - `/health` for health check
  - `/detect` for image processing
  - `/static/images/<path>` for serving static images
  - `/ws/video` for video streaming
- UI for demo options and language selection.

## What's Left to Build
- GPU deployment and performance tuning.
- High-confidence image capture logic.
- Complete profiling system.
- WhatsApp alert system with multi-language support.
- Integration of all components.
- Thorough testing and optimization.
- Removal of deprecated YOLOv8 code.

## Current Status
- Backend API is functional for image and video detection using MMDetection on CPU.
- Frame skipping is implemented for video to improve perceived performance.
- UI is implemented with demo options.
- Profiling and alert systems are in development.
- GPU deployment is the next major step for performance.
