# Project Progress

## What Works
- YOLOv8 model integration for weapon detection
- Flask API setup with endpoints:
  - `/health` for health check
  - `/detect` for image processing
  - `/static/<filename>` for serving annotated images
- Environment configuration with .env file
- Git configuration with proper .gitignore
- Directory structure maintained with .gitkeep files

## What's Left to Build
- Frontend UI components
- Real-time detection capabilities
- User authentication system
- Alert notification system
- Deployment configuration
- Testing suite

## Current Status
- Backend API is functional and properly configured
- Static file serving is implemented
- Git repository is properly configured with:
  - Appropriate .gitignore rules
  - Directory structure maintained
  - Test and annotated images excluded
- Development environment is properly set up

## Known Issues
- Port 5000 conflicts with AirPlay (resolved by using port 5001)
- Need to implement proper error handling
- Require additional security measures
- Performance optimization needed for large files
