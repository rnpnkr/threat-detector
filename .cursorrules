# Project Structure
- backend/
  - app.py (Flask API)
  - requirements.txt (Dependencies)
  - .env (Environment variables)
  - yolov8_model/
    - detecting-images.py (Detection logic)
    - runs/detect/Normal_Compressed/weights/best.pt (YOLOv8 model)
    - imgs/Test/ (Test images)

# Virtual Environment Setup
1. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run detection script:
   ```bash
   cd yolov8_model
   python detecting-images.py
   ```

4. Run Flask API:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

# API Endpoints
- GET /health - Health check
- POST /detect - Upload image and run detection
- GET /static/<filename> - Serve annotated images

# Dependencies
- Flask 2.3.3
- ultralytics 8.0.196
- torch 2.1.0
- torchvision 0.16.0
- opencv-python 4.8.1.78
- Other dependencies in requirements.txt

# Project Features
## Current Implementation
- Static image detection using YOLOv8
- Weapon detection (guns/knives)
- Bounding box visualization
- Basic Flask API

## In Progress
- Real-time video processing
- CCTV camera integration
- Profiling system
- WhatsApp alerts

## Future Features
- LLM integration for multi-language
- Enhanced profiling
- Additional threat categories

# Notes
- Always activate virtual environment before running scripts
- Model path: ./runs/detect/Normal_Compressed/weights/best.pt
- Detection threshold: 0.3 (30%)
- Supported image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- API runs on port 5001 (to avoid AirPlay conflict)
- Test images should be placed in backend/yolov8_model/imgs/Test/
- Annotated images are served from backend/static/images/

# Development Guidelines
1. Environment:
   - Use Python 3.8+
   - Always work in virtual environment
   - Keep requirements.txt updated

2. Testing:
   - Test with sample images in Test directory
   - Verify detection accuracy
   - Check API response times

3. Security:
   - Keep .env file secure
   - Don't commit sensitive data
   - Follow security best practices

4. Performance:
   - Monitor processing times
   - Optimize for real-time processing
   - Consider resource utilization
